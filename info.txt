Survive 1 minute to WIN!!!!

New spider spawns every 10 seconds from the pit in the center of the map
(adjust this to make appropriately difficult)

If you collide with a spider then you're half dead (you know when you're half dead because a blood trail follows you) - blood desponds after 5 seconds of being laid down
	If you survive 5 second
		you're back to full health
	else
		you die

When you die the Reaper spends by you're body and spiders fill the screen
